# Spring HTTP Session implementation backed by ScaleOut StateServer

## Introduction

The ScaleOut Spring HTTP Session library for Java allows developers to use ScaleOut StateServer to serve Java HttpSessions from the in-memory data grid to a Spring application. The library implements the spring-session-core Session and SessionRepository interfaces to store HTTP session objects within a specified Namespace in the in-memory data grid. 

Our **[docs](https://scaleoutsoftware.github.io/ScaleoutSpringHttpSessions/index.html)** will get you up and running in no time. 

This library is open source and has dependencies on other ScaleOut 
Software products.
